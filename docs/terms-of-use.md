# Terms of Use

# Agreement for the use of OpenIreland Testbed at CONNECT Centre, Trinity College Dublin, University of Dublin, Ireland.

**Terms and Conditions**

By accessing the OpenIreland TCD Testbed ("Testbed") *via* the internet platform provided by the CONNECT Centre ("CONNECT") Trinity College Dublin ("TCD") the user (hereinafter the "Participant") declares legally its acceptance of the terms and conditions of this User Agreement. Participant declares its consent that TCD is entitled to file Participant's personal data provided under these terms and conditions. TCD shall be entitled to use such data only for the administration of Participant's use of the Testbed. TCD reserves all rights not expressly granted to Participant under this User Agreement.

**Short description of the Testbed**

OpenIreland Testbed - the reconfigurable radio testbed at Trinity College Dublin provides virtualized radio hardware to support the experimental investigation of the interplay between radio capabilities and networks. Our facility pairs underlying flexible radio and computations resources with various hypervisors in the form of software radio frameworks to realize various research and testing configurations. We employ 16 ceiling mounted USRP N210s equipped with SBX daugtherboards, reaching frequencies between 40 MHz and 4.4 GHz, as underlying radio resources. These platforms are connected to a private computational cloud, allowing us to deploy an array of computational environments. To expose the functionality of these platforms for a variety of applications, we employ a variety of radio hypervisors, each with different capabilities. Together these radio hypervisors enable the realization of heterogeneous radio platforms for composition into networks. Therefore, this facility is ideally equipped to investigate the combination of various physical layer approaches into coexisting or coherent networks.
