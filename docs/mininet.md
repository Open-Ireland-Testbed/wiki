# Mininet

The Mininet-Optical framework is an optical network simulation system that incorporates physical transmission modelling into the Mininet packet-network emulator to enable the development and evaluation of optical control plane processes that depend on optical transmission performance. Data plane and control plane behaviour can be orchestrated using an SDN controller. Mininet-Optical can be used both as a sandbox environment to test packet-optical control plane solutions on OpenIreland before implementing them into the physical testbed and to test control plane application at scale (See Figure 1).
