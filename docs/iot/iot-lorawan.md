Pervasive Nation is Irelandâ€™s Internet of Things testbed operated by CONNECT, the Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Future Networks headquartered at Trinity College Dublin, the University of Dublin. Pervasive Nation is based on Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networking technology. The objective of Pervasive Nation is to build an Internet of Things testbed of scale which will become a resource for industry, government and academia, and act as a strong catalyst for Internet of Things research and innovation. The Pervasive Nation infrastructure uses the latest off-the-shelf LPWAN technologies, software-defined radio and Application Enablement Platform (AEP) technologies. These provide end-to-end connectivity allowing users to shape the future of the Internet of Things. Pervasive Nation is particularly suited to the connectivity and networking of small, simple devices in difficult to reach locations or in remote areas. These devices would normally require battery operation or have only small energy scavenging needs and require a low data rate.
