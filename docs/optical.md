# Optical

The optical capabilities of the OpenIreland testbed include over 1,700 km of fibre spools, ROADMs, amplifiers, coherent transponders, optical signal and noise monitors, in addition to typical optical laboratory equipment, such as spectrum analyser, real-time scope, optical filters, etc. The testbed is also fully reconfigurable, through the use of a large port count optical fibre switch, which manages the topology for any experiment. This functionality is supported by an SDN control plane primarily using the Nefconf protocol. This gives experimenters the ability to reconfigure the network and experiment equipment. Experimenters can also monitor and collect power and ASE noise and OSNR from optical testbed equipment. An overview of the Optical testbed equipment and network topology is available in Figure 2.
