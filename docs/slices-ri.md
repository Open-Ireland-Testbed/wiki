SLICES-RI



# SLICES-RI

The OpenIreland team are hoping to Join the SLICES-RI programme. Towards this goal we will give a talk to the HEANet community:

For the last 10+ years the OpenIreland testbed (<http://openireland.eu> )(formerly Iris Testbed) has participated in the EU Fed4FIRE and Fed4FIRE+ (<https://www.fed4fire.eu/> ) projects. These initiatives  have been proponents of open, accessible and reliable testbed facilities supporting a wide variety of research and innovation activities across radio, networking protocols, parallel and distributed computing, cloud and edge technologies for academia, SME and Industry. Fed4FIRE+ reached its conclusion in June 2022. Its continuance will be taken on by Slices-RI(<https://slices-ri.eu/> ) (2021-2038), the Scientific Large Scale Infrastructure for Computing/Communication Experimental Studies. SLICES-RI is a Europe-wide test-platform designed to support large-scale experimental research on Digital Infrastructures. The projects goal is to foster communities of researchers, and create and strengthen links with industrial stakeholders. In this talk we will outline the tools used for managing access to the testbeds and supporting sharing of testbed resources, and highlight the importance of experiment automation and data collection based on unambiguous code.
